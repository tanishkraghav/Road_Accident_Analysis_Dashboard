🚦 ROAD ACCIDENT ANALYSIS DASHBOARD
📊 Power BI | Data Analytics | Business Intelligence

An interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze road accident data and uncover meaningful insights related to casualties, accident severity, vehicle involvement, road conditions, and geographic patterns.

📌 PROJECT OVERVIEW

Road accidents are a critical public safety issue, but raw datasets often fail to communicate where, why, and how accidents happen.

This dashboard converts complex road accident data into clear, actionable insights that help answer questions such as:

📉 Are road accidents increasing or decreasing year-over-year?

🚗 Which vehicle types contribute most to casualties?

🌆 Are urban areas riskier than rural regions?

🛣️ Which road types are most accident-prone?

🌙 How do lighting conditions impact accident severity?

🗺️ Where are the major accident hotspots?

🎯 PROJECT OBJECTIVE

The primary goals of this project are to:

✅ Build an interactive and executive-friendly dashboard

📊 Identify patterns, trends, and risk factors in accident data

🚦 Support road safety analysis and policy decision-making

🔍 Enable multi-dimensional filtering and exploration

💡 Demonstrate strong skills in Power BI, DAX, and data storytelling

🛠️ TECH STACK

This project was built using the following tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop
→ Main platform for data modeling and visualization

🔄 Power Query
→ Data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing

🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
→ Custom KPIs, YoY comparisons, calculated measures

🧩 Data Modeling
→ Relationships between accident, casualty, vehicle, and location tables

🗺️ Bing Maps
→ Geographic visualization of accident hotspots

📁 File Formats
→ .pbix for development, .png for dashboard previews
