🚦 #Road Accident Analysis Dashboard | Power BI

An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze road accident data and uncover critical insights related to casualties, accident severity, vehicle involvement, road conditions, and geographic patterns. This project transforms raw accident data into meaningful, decision-ready insights that can help improve road safety and policy planning.

##📌 Project Overview

Road accidents are a major public safety concern, yet analyzing accident data in raw tabular form makes it difficult to identify trends and risk factors.

This dashboard answers key questions such as:

How have accidents and casualties changed year-over-year?

Which vehicle types contribute most to road casualties?

Are urban areas riskier than rural areas?

How do road type and lighting conditions affect accident severity?

Where are the accident hotspots geographically?

🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to:

Provide a clear, interactive view of road accident trends

Enable data-driven decision-making for road safety improvements

Identify high-risk factors such as vehicle type, road type, and lighting conditions

Support policy makers, analysts, and researchers with actionable insights

🛠️ Tech Stack
